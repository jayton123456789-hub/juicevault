Introduction
Welcome to the Juice WRLD API documentation. This comprehensive database contains detailed information about Juice WRLD's entire discography, including released tracks, unreleased songs, unsurfaced material, and studio recording sessions. The database is organized into four main categories with rich metadata for each track.

Tracker
The Tracker is your hub for exploring the full collection. Use filters and search to find songs quickly:

Category: switch between released, unreleased, unsurfaced, and recording sessions.
Era: narrow results by Juice WRLD career era.
Search: search across titles, credited artists, and producers.
Pagination/Infinite Scroll: browse large result sets smoothly.
Player
The Player shows tracks that are playable and streamable. You can preview, queue, and download playable content.

Playable list: songs with available audio files.
Stream: click a song to start playback.
Queue: build a playlist during a session.
Share: create a shareable playlist link when needed.
Radio
Radio mode surfaces a random playable track. It’s a great way to discover songs without browsing manually.

Randomize: fetch a random playable song with a single click.
Quick play: instantly play or add to your queue.
Files
The Files page lets you browse the organized collection, preview cover art, and download individual files or ZIPs of selected items.

Browse folders: navigate the Compilation, Original Files, and other directories.
Search: filter by name or extension (e.g., “.mp3”, “.wav”, “.zip”).
Cover art: hover or open file info to view embedded artwork when available.
Download: download a single file directly.
ZIP selection: select multiple items and create a ZIP for bulk download.
Sharing & Playlists
For larger or curated sets, generate a shareable playlist link.

Create share: build a playlist and save a share link.
Preview: use the share preview to check details before opening.
Load from link: paste a shared link to load playlist contents.
